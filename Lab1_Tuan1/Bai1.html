        We know that the inernet is a wonderful place to visit but why do
        some things on a web page catch our eye more than others. It is
        because of the <i>formatting</i> and the <b>emphasis</b> of different
        elements to a page. <b>Bold</b> <i>italic</i> <u>underline</u>
        <em>em</em> and <strong>strong</strong> are all tags that
        can be used for this task.
